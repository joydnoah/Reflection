When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  
  When i want to have access from anywhere, or when i have a project with many people and i want to share and compare our progress

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because if it is a project of many people you wold want to review changes before pulling
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	branches are new versions of a program that are different from the main one, clones are copies of repositories and forks are the same as clones but only for github

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	So anychanges made in the cloud can be taking into acount before pushing.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	I would copy my own version of the files of someone else, it would be easier to show my changes, but merging would be hard, im sure it would become another project and at some point diverge.
